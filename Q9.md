# Q.9

What will the code below output to the console and why?

```javascript
var arr1 = "john".split('');

var arr2 = arr1.reverse();

var arr3 = "jones".split('');

arr2.push(arr3);

console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));

console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));
```

# Question 9 Answer

## The code will output the following to the console:

```javascript
array 1: length=5 last=s,o,n,e,j
array 2: length=5 last=s,o,n,e,j
```

Explanation:

1. var arr1 = "john".split('');: This line creates arr1 as an array containing individual characters of the string "john". So, arr1 will be ['j', 'o', 'h', 'n']. <br><br>

2. var arr2 = arr1.reverse();: This line assigns arr1 to arr2 and then reverses arr2 in place. As arr1 and arr2 reference the same array in memory, both arr1 and arr2 will be reversed. Now arr1 and arr2 will both be ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j'].<br><br>

3. var arr3 = "jones".split('');: This line creates arr3 as an array containing individual characters of the string "jones". So, arr3 will be ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'].<br><br>

4. arr2.push(arr3);: This line pushes the arr3 array as a single element to the end of arr2, which is already modified with reverse(). So, arr2 will now be ['n', 'h', 'o', 'j', ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']].<br><br>

5. console.log("array 1: length=" + arr1.length + " last=" + arr1.slice(-1));: This line prints the length of arr1 (which is 4) and the last element of arr1 (which is 'j').

6. console.log("array 2: length=" + arr2.length + " last=" + arr2.slice(-1));: This line prints the length of arr2 (which is 5) and the last element of arr2 (which is ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's']). Since arr2 was modified with reverse() and push(), it contains the array ['j', 'o', 'n', 'e', 's'] as the last element.<br><br>

In summary, the output shows that both arr1 and arr2 are reversed versions of the original "john" string, and they both have the arr3 array as the last element.
