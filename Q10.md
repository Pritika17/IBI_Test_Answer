# Q.10
What will the following code's output be in sequence and explain why?

```javascript
function printNumber(num) {
  console.log(num);
}

console.log(1);

setTimeout(printNumber, 0, 2);
setTimeout(printNumber, 100, 3);

console.log(4);
```

# Q.10 Answer

Output Sequence and Explanation:

1. The first console.log(1) is executed immediately when encountered in the code. So, it logs 1 to the console.<br/>

2. The second console.log(4) is executed after the first one, as it comes after the first console.log. It logs 4 to the console.<br/>

3. The function printNumber(2) is scheduled to be executed with setTimeout and a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is set to 0, it's not executed immediately. It will be added to the JavaScript event loop and executed after the current execution stack is clear. So, it logs 2 to the console after the first two logs.<br/>

4. The function printNumber(3) is scheduled to be executed with setTimeout and a delay of 100 milliseconds. It will be executed after the 0-millisecond delay callback. So, it logs 3 to the console after the 2.<br/>

The output sequence is: 
```javascript
1
2
3
4
```
The synchronous code runs first, and then the asynchronous callbacks are executed in the order they were scheduled.
