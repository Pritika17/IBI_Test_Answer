# Q.11

Check the below given code, if there are any issues, fix them and explain the output

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {

  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
});

console.log(result);
```

# Q.11 Answer

The given code has a small issue in the usage of reduce() because it does not provide an initial value for the accumulator. The initial value should be an object with properties evens and odds as arrays. Let's fix the code and explain the output:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

const result = numbers.reduce((acc, num) => {
  if (num % 2 === 0) {
    acc.evens.push(num);
  } else {
    acc.odds.push(num);
  }
  return acc;
}, { evens: [], odds: [] }); // Provide initial value as an object with evens and odds as empty arrays

console.log(result);
```

Output:

```javascript
{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }
```

### Explanation:

1. The numbers array contains [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].

2. The reduce() method iterates through each element of the numbers array and accumulates the even and odd numbers into separate arrays. Initially, the accumulator acc is an object with properties evens and odds, both initialized as empty arrays.

3. When the num is 1, it's an odd number, so it's added to the acc.odds array.

4. When the num is 2, it's an even number, so it's added to the acc.evens array.

5. Similarly, for 3 (odd) and 4 (even), they are added to the respective arrays.

6. Finally, 5 is an odd number and added to the acc.odds array.

7. The reduce() method returns the final accumulated object with two properties: evens containing [2, 4], and odds containing [1, 3, 5].

8. The console.log(result) outputs the final result object:

### Output:

```javascript
{ evens: [2, 4], odds: [1, 3, 5] }
```

The fixed code successfully accumulates even and odd numbers separately into their respective arrays within the result object.
