# Q.8
 In what order will the numbers 1-4 be logged to the console when the code below is executed? Why?
```javascript
(function() {

    console.log(1);

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(2)}, 1000);

    setTimeout(function(){console.log(3)}, 0);

    console.log(4);

})();
```

# Q8 Answer

## The numbers 1, 4, 3, and 2 will be logged to the console in the following order:

1. 1: This is a regular console.log statement and will be executed immediately when the IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is called. <br/><br/>
2. 4: This is also a regular console.log statement and will be executed after the first one, as it comes right after the first console.log.<br/><br/>
3. 3: This console.log statement is inside a setTimeout with a delay of 0 milliseconds. Even though the delay is set to 0, it's not truly executed immediately. It will be added to the JavaScript event loop and executed once the current execution stack is clear. So, it will be logged after the first two logs (1 and 4).<br/><br/>
4. 2: This console.log statement is inside a setTimeout with a delay of 1000 milliseconds. It will be executed after the other logs, following the 1-millisecond delay of the third log.
<br/>
<br/>
So, the final output in the console will be:

```js
1
4
3
2
```
